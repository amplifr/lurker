## Installation

Add my public key:

    gem cert --add <(curl -Ls https://raw.github.com/razum2um/lurker/master/certs/razum2um.pem)

    $ gem install lurker                 # without key
    $ gem install lurker -P HighSecurity # secure, with key added

Or this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'lurker'

Inject into `test_helper.rb` or `spec_helper.rb`:

    require 'lurker/spec_helper'

## Usage

Wrap your intergation test code, which does request like this

    Lurker::Spy.on do
      get "/api/v1/users.json"
    end

And run the specs and commit your schemas. That's all, easy!

## RSpec usage

Write your RSpec [controller][rspec_controller_spec] or [request][rspec_request_spec] specs as usual,
but add `:lurker` mark (like documented [controller example][controler_spec_example] or [request spec example][request_spec_example]).

    it "lists users", :lurker do
      get "/api/v1/users.json"
    end

## Minitest usage

You can use [minitest-around][minitest_around] to wrap your test classes like this:

    class DestroyRepoTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
      def around(&block)
        Lurker::Spy.on(&block)
      end
    end

You also can wrap any block with api requests [manually][minitest_example].

## Schemas

Please, commit your files under `Rails.root/lurker` directory.
Feel free to edit them according to [json-schema][json_schema] standart.
It can be very strict and flexible if you wish: see [example][json_schema_example],
but scaffolded schemas are pretty good by default.

    A  lurker/ExampleApp.service.yml
    A  lurker/api/v1/users-GET.json.yml
    A  lurker/api/v1/users/__user_id/repos-GET.json.yml

I also advise you to look on [Understanding JSON Schema][json_schema_book] book,
it is up-to-date with draft4 and contains lot's of examples.

## Profit!

Now, every test run lurker will look into your requests and [vaditate them][failed_spec_example]
and it fails if your code changes the api!

    Failure/Error: post :create [...]
    Lurker::ValidationError:
      Request
      - The property '#/' contains additional properties ["social_network"] outside of the schema
        when none are allowed in schema file:///.../lurker/api/v1/users-POST.json.yml#
      Response
      - The property '#/user/last_sign_in_at' of type String did not match the following type:
        null in schema file:///.../lurker/api/v1/users-POST.json.yml#

Let's run your `rails s` and visit [http://localhost:3000/lurker/](http://localhost:3000/lurker/)
(or see [demo][demo_app2] for example)

Now, you can test your API on-line (for real)

## [Demo application][demo_app3]

You can clone the repo & run `rake build_example_docs && cd tmp/lurker_app && bin/rails s`
to get your running demo.

Lurker supports multiple domains (usually `staging` and `production`) and can be deployed
statically everywhere as well as be served by current `Rails` instance.

For example:

- [Github Pages][demo_app3] is deployed statically; no api endpoint
- [Custom domain][demo_app2] html deployed under nginx; passenger serves demo api production endpoint
- [Heroku][demo_app] html is served by unicorn as well as staging api endpoint in `Sandbox` mode

## Features

- [Autoscaffolding for non-covered API endpoints][controler_spec_example]
- [Autotesting for covered endpoint once written][failed_spec_example] (both request & response!)
- [Pretty HTML documentation based on your schemas][html_generation_example]
- [Pretty submit form to test API endpoints (live) based on schemas][demo_live] (enter a name & press "Submit")
- [Handling URLs with dynamic segments][nested_controller_spec_example] (such as `api/v1/:user_id/repos`)
- [JSON-Schema partials][partial_example], also in YAML format ([demo][partial_example_demo])
- [Generation PDF documentation][pdf_example]
- [Multiple docs for many usecases][suffixes_example] (e.g `:lurker => '...'`)
- ERB support inside `.json.yml.erb`
- HTTP-Auth authorization for your online docs
- Separate API-services generated within one test suite
- Capistrano integration
- JSON-Schema draft-v4 support
- Static site deploy and milti-domain support
- Builtin Rack middlware `Lurker::Server.to_rack` serves cached digested assets
- [RSpec][failed_spec_example] & [Minitest][minitest_example] support

## Token authentication with sandbox

`Lurker::Sandbox` allows you to test services with token authentication:

    # make sure it's not production!
    # e.g. config/environtents/staging.rb
    config.middleware.use Lurker::Sandbox

E.g. demo application on Heroku runs with it: when creating, updating repos or users
ids getting increased, but if you look into GET #index,
new items are NOT showing up. **This is NOT a bug!** - sequences in postgres
are increasing notwithstanding ROLLBACK is called. As such:

- run all your specs with **the same** testing token
- ensure the same token to be accepted on your demo application
- insert `Lurker::Sandbox` and the recorded examples should be ok to submit again

[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/razum2um/lurker.png?label=ready&title=Ready&_=1)][waffle]

I try to use [Waffle][waffle] to develop this gem, if you want to help:

- look on "Ready" section
- drag an issue to "In Progress" and assign to yourself
- have fun!

**NOTE:** to get new version of bundled `bootstrap` or update js/css,
don't touch files under `lib/lurker/templates/public` - they are autogenerated
and copied to static generated site while `bin/lurker convert`

    rake assets:precompile # to build them

Don't commit `lib/lurker/templates/public/**/*` to avoid conflicts.

**NOTE:** if you write features keep in mind to generate different files with aruba,
because they are kept in `lurker_app` directory to be deployed as a demo. Please, write
features in a way to generate **new** relevant `lurker/**/*.json.yml` files

To run cucumber in a clean `lurker` & `html` directories run:

    CLEAN=1 cucumber features

**NOTE:** template partial `submit_form.html.erb` and it's partials is a big `jsx` script for `React`
so there are `<label htmlFor` instead of `<label for>` and `<div className` instead of `<div class`

## Acknoledgements

Sponsored by [Evil Martians][evil_martians], thanks!

This gem is quite opinionated and relies on rails - if you're
interested in anything else, please take a look at [api_taster][api_taster] or [fdoc][fdoc],
This gem is heavily inspirated by them. Thanks, @square & @fredwu
